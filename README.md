Meet the team: Ratna Jadhav, Arnaz Alavi, Ratika Chauhan, Seong-Min Kim, Junaid Dawood 

### Introduction
As residents of Chicago, we found it fitting to create an interactive dashboard to visualize Crime Data in our city. We wanted to provide a place for anybody to be able to click around and easily get information about crime rates in Chicago![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85905358/139990135-989b967b-0838-4f13-a8ae-9461721082d5.png)

Responsibilities: 
ETL: Seong-Min
Front-End HTML: Ratika
Graph 1: Ratna
Graph 2: Arnaz
Graph 3: Junaid

In order to create an interactive visual to display the data we found, we will be completing the following processes:
1. To clean up data (ETL), we are using Pandas. 
2. We will be loading our data into the mongodb. The data will be loaded directly from Pandas. 
3. Build the front end schema of the visuals using HTML 
4. Plot a couple pie plots, bar graphs, bubble graphs, search of a districts/neighborhoods (by zip code), and a map of the data using D3 (mapping web). 
    * Create flask applications for each visual
    * Combine all flask applications to consolidate all visuals
